<p><i>In the not wholly grateful task of adapting this play to the present
demands of the English and American stage, partly as those demands have
been interpreted by others than me, numerous alterations have been
thought necessary. I hope that this adaptation does not conceal the fact
that Mr. Heijermans' original is a work of very admirable unity and
force.</i></p>

<p class="scene"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>A street in the Ghetto in Amsterdam. On the left the shop of</i>
<span class="smcap">Sachel</span>. <i>Running down from the centre to the right, diagonally, the
wall of a canal; a bridge across the canal; a vista of the river and
the city at the back.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Samson</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Daniel</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Samson.</span></p>

<p>Have trade and traffic gone to bed for Sabbath?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span></p>

<p>Not till old Sachel shuts his shop. See, he sits there in the gloom like
a spider waiting in its web. He would keep open all night for two
cents.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Samson.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>He's waiting for his son. What if the old man knew that Rafael spent
half his time composing music&mdash;music for which he gets nothing? He would
lock the door on Rafael to-night.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span></p>

<p>Let him! The world shall hear from Rafael. Wait till we play his music.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Samson.</span></p>

<p>But he still has time to devote to his father's Christian servant-maid.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span></p>

<p>Eh&mdash;you have noticed too? [<i>They look into the shop.</i>] Ah, see her! I
say, she's the handsomest in Amsterdam&mdash;high or low! You had better be
careful what you say about her to Rafael.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Samson.</span></p>

<p>I am. When I spoke a trifle lightly of her, he offered to smash my head
with your 'cello.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span></p>

<p>And you apologized?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Samson.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>Not wanting it smashed.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span></p>

<p>Meaning your head.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Samson.</span></p>

<p>No, meaning your 'cello. But I shall proceed with her. She is unhappy&mdash;I
think she needs <i>me</i>!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Mordecai</span>, <i>with a piece of lace, by way of the bridge. He goes
into the shop.</i></p>

<p>I thought we had done with trade in this street. There goes an old sheep
to pawn his fleece. I say&mdash;bah!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span></p>

<p>So will the old sheep say "Bah!" when Sachel has shorn him. See the old
man feeling it over&mdash;they say he can tell brass from gold by the touch
of his talons.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Samson.</span></p>

<p>It is well the old man is blind; if he saw the look of disgust on the
girl's face&mdash;ay, she'd like to rush out in the air!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>If she hates trade so, why does she stay in the Ghetto?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Samson.</span></p>

<p>She has nowhere else to go&mdash;she doesn't appear to want to get away. Are
they cursing each other over a copper? See the curl of her lip! Look!
look!</p>

<p class="right">[<span class="smcap">Rosa</span> <i>rushes out of the shop</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>[<i>As if stifling.</i>] Oh! oh! they have no souls&mdash;there is not a soul
among them, save Rafael's!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Samson.</span></p>

<p>No, I suppose not. Is Rafael at home?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Samson.</span></p>

<p>No&mdash;he stays away, he is in love?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Daniel.</span></p>

<p>With whom?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Samson.</span></p>

<p>With somebody&mdash;somebody. I read between the notes of his music. He's
fallen in love and he's put it all into music. [<i>Insinuatingly.</i>] Do you
know who she is?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>[<i>She gets a broom and begins to sweep.</i>] How should I, a Christian, be
so deep in his confidence?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Samson.</span></p>

<p>As deep in his confidence as need be. But do not trust him too much.
Ah&mdash;[<i>quasi-regretful</i>]&mdash;and I am his friend. But it is love that has
made a fool of me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>No, I should not lay it to the door of love.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Samson.</span></p>

<p>It <i>is</i> love. If I could look into such eyes as yours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> and my heart not
smoke like&mdash;like a burning haycock, then I should be more fool than now.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>You could not be. With whom do you mean to insinuate that Rafael is
carrying on a love affair?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Samson.</span></p>

<p>Oh, not you!</p>

thieves! Ah, I know you are standing there, twisting your cheeks at me!
But you shall not rob me; no, no! Give me that! [<i>He takes the lace and

until Rafael came home? It struck twelve as he went to his room. It was
not five minutes later when I hear steps along the hall&mdash;yes, I can hear
steps, though the shoes be off! I heard steps, and then your door
opened. Why do you stop? I heard your door open; what does it mean?</p>

<p>I did not leave my room.</p>

dwindling, dwindling with every ticking of the clock! And he wants me to

been utterly destroyed; at the thought of having vexed you I should have
beaten my brow. And now it's gone&mdash;gone&mdash;and it won't come back&mdash;it

<p>Is it but three years ago that I was so ignorant, so raw, and so fond of
you? I had known you with the fire of life in your eyes, and now it had
gone; the light of your soul was as hidden in a dungeon, because you
were blind. Ah, how I suffered! I shut my eyes to imagine it&mdash;darkness,
black nothing; God's beautiful sky gone for ever, as if you were in your
coffin under ground! Awful! Awful! And this, this was my father&mdash;my
father, whom I loved and honoured, of all the world!</p>

<p>I honoured you because you asked the sympathy of no man. I <i>honoured</i>
you. Shall I ever forget that Friday, when I stood alone in the gloom of
this warehouse, watching you, sorrowing over your blindness, with tears
in my eyes! You stood by the scales. They were weighing out your
merchandise; the man who had bought it stooped and shifted the weights;
and your creature Jacob read the figures out and you wrote them down in
great coarse scrawls&mdash;your grey head bare, your face turned up to
heaven. How I loved you&mdash;how I pitied you! You bore yourself with such
calm&mdash;such fortitude&mdash;as if, when God had touched your eyes, He had
whispered into your ears some portion of the everlasting truth. No one
saw me&mdash;I was back in the shadow. And I started forward; I wanted to
say, "Father&mdash;go in; father, never labour again! Sit in your chair&mdash;rest
always&mdash;while I do your bidding&mdash;while I do everything!" But I did not
say it. No! I stopped; I slunk back into the deepest shadow like a
criminal. I had uttered a cry, but you and Jacob did not hear me. On the
platform of the scales, when your client stooped to balance them, I had
seen a foot go out&mdash;go out while your white face was turned in holy calm
to heaven&mdash;go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> out and press down&mdash;so that the scales read false&mdash;so
that the man who bought our goods was tricked and robbed&mdash;robbed of the
money we had not earned from him. And again I saw it, and again, and
again, father! And the man whose foot went out and did this crime, the
man who was stealing and stealing, time after time, stealing his money,
stealing my respect, my honour, my youth, before my eyes&mdash;was it Jacob?
No, it was you&mdash;you, my father&mdash;my father, whom I loved and pitied, and
they had trusted&mdash;because you were blind!</p>

<p>And that afternoon I went with my father to the synagogue; I did not
pray, I could not speak. I only gazed at my father's face, waiting to
see it soften into some shade of doubt, of repentance, of remorse. And
the dead eyes faced up to the rafters where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> sun shone through&mdash;they
faced up there with the same impassive stare&mdash;the same holy calm, as
when he stood with his foot on the scales. Ah, when we walked home, how
cold and pitiless the sky looked down at me that winter day! We sat at
our Sabbath table. He complained that I was silent. He said prayers, he
dipped the bread in the salt. The lamplight shone on him, and I stared
into his face, and I saw nothing&mdash;nothing I had always thought I
saw&mdash;and my heart was ice; and he rose and stumbled over a stool and
fell, and I picked him up&mdash;and my heart was still ice. He was no longer
blind to me&mdash;he was nothing&mdash;nothing but a&mdash;ah no, no,&mdash;what's the
use&mdash;what's the use?</p>

Hah! It is well that I have found you out before this thing has gone too
far. Don't I know your damned tricks; <i>you</i> wouldn't be satisfied with a
passing touch of his lips. You've got a brain&mdash;a lying, scheming,
devilish brain! You want his heart&mdash;you want his soul! By God! [<i>He goes

<p>Sachel, my father helped your people!</p>

believe he was sent out of hell to steal away men's souls, as you were.
You've found something to fight when you've come across me! Shall I feel
a snake in my bosom and not cast it out? [<i>He points to the door.</i>]
You&mdash;[<i>He checks himself; a pause.</i>] Shut the door! Go on with your
work! [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Rosa</span>.] No, no, no&mdash;it won't do to <i>tear</i> him away from her.
She is beautiful;&mdash;we must marry him to Rebecca. Rebecca is handsome,
Rebecca is rich, Rebecca is minx enough. We must marry him to Rebecca if
we can. If not, to some one else&mdash;any one else, as soon as we can. But
we must handle him with care. Ah! I had better get the Rabbi to talk to
him; the Rabbi has tact. And, for the present, we must let Rosa be.</p>

who is wrong?&mdash;a soul that fears poverty, disinheritance, the hatred of
the Ghetto? You fear that you would be cast off, that you would suffer
want and ridicule, that your father would never feed you and clothe you
again; and when that fear comes into your heart what room is left for
me? Love! Ugh! Ugh! What is <i>your</i> love! The love of the way that is

<p>[<i>Slowly, sorrowfully.</i>] And now <i>you</i> say "Jew!" "Jew!" as they say it

strange from lips that I thought loved me; it sounds strange from the
daughter of your father! Such a man he was! When you and I had our first
long talks together, and you told me of the noble deeds your father had
done in behalf of the Jews, I couldn't help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> loving you for his sake;
and now you call me Jew! I <i>am</i> a Jew. Never forget that I am a Jew. I
have married you; and when it is known I shall have no standing among
Jews. The orthodox will avoid me as a pariah, and the mob of Jews will
howl at me when I go into the street. And I shall still be a Jew&mdash;proud
of my race, proud of its fortitude, of the great triumph which shall
come to us Jews when we have shaken off the material shell which hides
our spirits, and makes us no better and no worse than the Christians!
No, no! You are angry&mdash;you don't care what you say! You are angry&mdash;and
you sneer at my father. What do you know against my father's honesty?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>Dares not! Dares not! Ah, you little know me if you think that! Rosa,
Rosa! Look here! My dear little girl, you are all wrong. We have agreed
on this point. It was yourself who said that we must not tell of our
marriage yet. [<span class="smcap">Rosa</span> <i>sinks into a chair</i>.] You said that I must give my
time to my music, until I had made a name&mdash;until we could go forth on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
our own footing&mdash;not cast out of that door&mdash;without a cent between us,
to be reviled and hustled by the mob. And I thought of my father&mdash;of his
old age&mdash;of his pain. If he <i>is</i> wrong&mdash;if he <i>is</i> what he should not
be, he's still my father&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coming down a step.</i>] You don't seem to have much sentiment about it,
Rafael.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>Ah, if it were only a matter of sentiment! [<i>She comes down two steps.</i>]
But sentiment after business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> Rebecca, after business. I am 40 inches
round the chest, Rebecca; and if my heart should swell I should be
doubtless 45. But at eight thousand guilders, Rebecca, it doesn't swell!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></p>

<p>But I&mdash;I don't like to talk this way, Rafael; it doesn't seem to me
quite&mdash;quite nice.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>That is your delicacy, Rebecca, your extreme delicacy. But we must not
mix delicacy with business, Rebecca. He sticks at eight thousand, and
not a thing, I suppose, in the way of dresses, finery, rigging&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></p>

<p>It's really most unpleasant to have to talk of such things. Of course I
shall have a dozen of everything; father has told me so&mdash;when I am&mdash;when
I&mdash;I can't say it! I really can't speak of it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>That's your shrinking nature, Rebecca, your extreme sensitiveness! H'm!
How should a man's heart know which way to beat? On the one side the
daughter, with her delicacy, her shrinking nature; on the other side the
father, who sticks at eight thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> guilders! No; at eight thousand I
will not love you. It would not be dignified at eight thousand!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coming down the remaining steps.</i>] But you don't suppose that if my
father were willing to give, say, ten thousand, he would begin at more
than eight thousand; not with <i>your</i> father&mdash;now would he, Rafael? But I
think that nowadays, when young people are to be&mdash;when they intend&mdash;they
ought to have some sentiment for each other.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>H'm!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></p>

<p>And, moreover, I think that young men should be more careful as to how
they let themselves be talked about&mdash;more careful than you are. They
call you an infidel, Rafael, and they say disagreeable things about you
and this impertinent servant of yours.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>They do! [<i>A pause.</i>] Of course, if we were to contemplate
matrimony&mdash;you and I&mdash;such a matter would be very serious.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></p>

<p>It certainly would.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>And so it's very fortunate, Rebecca, that we have been talking in a kind
of irony&mdash;you and I&mdash;over a matter which was never even remotely
possible! Isn't it?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></p>

<p>[<i>After a pause.</i>] Yes, <i>very</i> fortunate. It would have been most
unfortunate for you if you had ever entertained the idea. If your father
or mine entertain it, we must speedily end that. Go on with your
scullerymaid; it's nothing to me.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>No, it's nothing to you, Rebecca! You and I don't want to marry, and
they are trying to chain us together against our wills! We must fight
them, Rebecca! We must put our backs against the wall! Your father will
whisper avarice to you. He'll bid you look around. "This is thy
neighbour's house," he'll say. "It will all be Rafael's;
see&mdash;see&mdash;treasure, value, gain; see the jewels there, the gold and
silver, the rich laces and old articles of art&mdash;all his, my girl&mdash;and
his father will die soon! He'll die of joy if he gets eight thousand
guilders with his daughter-in-law. And then it will be all yours&mdash;yours
and Rafael's; yours to hug and wrap your soul around, my girl;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
all&mdash;all, from the last atom of diamond dust in the cases there, to the
rust on the nail in the latch on the door that keeps away the moans of
the starving!"</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></p>

<p>But do you think&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>But you won't be betrayed by an old man's lust for gold. No! You'll say:
"Father, I have a heart; I will not give myself to one I do not love, to
soothe your itching palm!" You'll look well saying that, Rebecca! You'll
stand and face him in the dignity of truth! You'll be defending the next
generation against the crawling viper of greed! I'd like to be there!
I'd like to see the flash in your eyes; even now you cannot think of it
without fire in your look! I see the anger of righteousness; I cannot
too deeply express my respect, Rebecca!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></p>

<p>Do you think I don't know what you mean? You think I want to marry
you&mdash;to get you away from this vile creature&mdash;this unthinkable person
who&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rosa</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></p>

<p>Oh! She calls you Rafael! She was listening all the time! What they say
is true: you thrust your shameful doings in my face! I shall tell my
father&mdash;I shall tell everyone; they will stone you from the Ghetto! You
tried to make a fool of me; and you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">[<i>She bursts into tears. Exit.</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>And now I'm going to break my poor old father's heart. I am going to
tell him that you and I were married by the Civil Authority beyond the
Ghetto, that we are one and indivisible. Poor old man! I am not without
love for my father, you know. He will think that I am lost for ever; he
will turn me away from his door with a curse on his lips; and then, when
we are gone, he'll sink down in his chair and weep; a broken life, an
old age come to nothing! And he may die at any moment&mdash;it may kill
him&mdash;and he <i>might</i> have died and never have known it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Rafael, I can't be the cause of his death! Don't tell him, Rafael! I
will try to live on&mdash;as we are.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>Live on as we are, with this doubt in your heart? You have said I dared
not face poverty for your sake. Such a doubt must be killed at any cost.
I won't have it coming back to you to mar your faith in me in after
years. No; there's no question of my not telling him; there's only the
question of how to tell him.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>Rafael, I would rather you wouldn't! I have been selfish; I forgot about
your father; I forgot about your music.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>My father will probably speak first of Rebecca. I shall say: "No,
father, I will marry no woman I do not love." Then that will be settled;
my father will let the matter drop. Then I shall tell him about you.
Either he will be violent or he will ask me a few questions between his
teeth, such as: "How much money have you?"</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>Nothing!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Or, "What vocation are you master of?"</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>The music&mdash;if he could only hear&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>My father is as deaf to my art as he is blind. "Are you master of an
art, when it will not yield you bread?" he will say.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>But it will yield you bread, if you will but wait, Rafael!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>I was very happy when I came through that door. I saw Hanakoff this
morning. He is going to play my Fantasia to-night, Rosa, before the
aristocracy; he is going to let me lead his orchestra! And in a month he
would have played my Symphony!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>Would have! Why not, then?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>Why not? It won't be possible, Rosa.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be possible! Why not? Why not?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>Well, because the Symphony isn't finished, and in the time when I
thought to finish it I shall be working with my hands to keep us from
starving&mdash;if a man can keep from starving by working with his hands!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>Rafael, you shall not tell your father! You shall not sacrifice your
career to me. I wounded you too deeply. I didn't mean what I said&mdash;I
didn't realise what I was doing. See, dear, we must wait for the
Symphony. You must go on with your work&mdash;you must have peace&mdash;you must
know that I love you&mdash;that I cannot doubt you! Don't you feel that the
music will succeed?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>It must succeed! It's beautiful. My God, I know it's beautiful! Because
it is you, Rosa, shining through my art, lifting up my spirit till I
can't call the work mine. It comes from you and from God!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>Then, against my will, will you put me between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> God and the message he
sends to the world through you? No!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>I must accept the challenge you have made. I am a musician; but I'm a
man first!</p>

<p class="right">[<i>She weeps.</i></p>

<p>Don't&mdash;don't! And this is the day I had looked forward to for so many
weary months; my music has found a great man who believes in it, and on
that day my spirit is sunken within me; I am waiting to give my father a
blow that may kill him, and the woman I love so tenderly is sobbing her
foolish little heart out on my knee!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Springing up.</i>] Not now! I have stopped sobbing&mdash;the tears have
cleared my eyes&mdash;I see better than you! I will not have you magnify the
doubt I threw into my angry words. There was no doubt; I spoke falsely.
Have I not given you my life? I should not dare to doubt you! There are
things that must not, shall not be done. We are going to pass through a
fire of hatred, scorn, ridicule. We <i>must</i> have success,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> we <i>must</i>
triumph, and we must protect your father from harm. Go! Tell your father
you cannot marry Rebecca; tell him he must not think of that. Lead him
home, speak kind words to him, but don't tell him of me. And then go to
work on your Symphony. You say I inspired it. You touch my vanity. I
want to inspire it to the end! Don't mind me, don't think of me. Work,
work, and only let me once in a while come softly, silently, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">[<i>She kisses his hand.</i></p>

<p>Rosa! Rosa! How you tempt me! I want to do what is right. I can't tell
which it is, but the child of my soul is coming forth into the world,
and your kiss is so like a mother's kiss&mdash;it seems to bid me be gentle
to my child&mdash;not to kill it before it is born. Oh, how I love my
music&mdash;love it because it lets me express my love for you! I say the

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rabbi.</span></p>

<p>Silly old man! Not at all. An affectionate father, deeply troubled about
his only child&mdash;sorely vexed because too many things have gone wrong at
once! Would you have him sit still and not open his month? Oh no, Sachel
is not the man to let things take care of themselves!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span></p>

<p>It is true! What does she know about the feelings of a parent? Ah, I
would mould things now, Rabbi, but times have changed. Once, as it is
written in the Books of Moses, a son must obey his father, or he would
be stoned to the gates of the city! That was right!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rabbi.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>It was right then; but, as you so very rightly observe, Sachel, times
have changed; and when one throws stones now, one must pay for the
windows. So, instead of stoning Rafael, we shall marry him to Rebecca;
and in time you shall be the grandfather of a boy; a boy, I say! Ha, ha,
ha! You don't laugh enough, Sachel!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span></p>

<p>I cannot laugh! I tell you there is a serpent in my house. This
girl&mdash;this Rosa, I could swear that she&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rabbi.</span></p>

<p>Shame! shame! I won't hear about it! It was for you that I was
preaching, but you do not listen when you come to synagogue. Of course,
you were thinking about Rafael. You leave him to me. He shall marry
Rebecca, do you hear? In such matters as this you are a child!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span></p>

<p>He shall do my bidding, or he shall go in rags! 'Sh!</p>

<p>Since last I came to the synagogue I have had time to grow.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rabbi.</span></p>

<p>I pass that over. I don't look upon you as gone astray. You are seeking
for the light, and when you find it, whether you think so now or not,
you will find it there! [<i>Indicating the synagogue.</i>] Just as when you
find happiness you will find it here.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>In the house of Aaron?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rabbi.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>With your father, and at home, under the roof where your mother lived.
Ah! what a fine career is open to you in following out your father's
business! It isn't every boy who has such opportunities!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>Business! You in your synagogue&mdash;you ought to be the enemy of business.
You ought to preach it to our people without end that their life of
morning, noon, and night, and not a breath drawn but for sake of gain,
is a sickly mockery of life, and that it is against the law of Moses!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rabbi.</span></p>

<p>Another prophet! Business, gain, contrary to the laws of Moses! Go on,
my boy! Let us have the sermon you would preach! Ha, ha! Go on! Now I
shall learn something.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>Have I not read in the Book of Moses how the people divided the soil,
and there was no one who had more than another; and there was no
grinding of the poor, and there was never any selling of lands: "For
mine is the soil, and you are but strangers unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> Me!" And among them
was not business despised? How did Jacob speak of Issachar?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rabbi.</span></p>

<p>Bravo! "A strong ass," eh? Ha, ha, ha! You've been deep in the
Pentateuch. Where will you find such inspirations in any other Sacred
Book? But you should read them under guidance, you foolish boy!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>Under guidance! There is a guidance born in me that takes me where I am,
and I do not fear! It is a guidance that lives to-day; it is not a
guidance dug from the bones of a dead people of the dim past! I know.
You are going to say that Solomon did business, that David did business.
I don't care if they did! And you tell me that I skim the surface, that
I miss the spirit of the Jewish faith; and I tell you that it is this
spirit that my soul revolts against&mdash;the spirit that holds our people in
chains&mdash;the chains of the Ghetto!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rabbi.</span></p>

<p>Ghetto! There is no Ghetto! We do not live in Ghettos now, my boy!
Preposterous!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>And now <i>you</i> are skimming the surface, and <i>you</i> will not see the truth
that underlies! You say there is no Ghetto! Could I ever play with any
but another Jew when I was a child? Could I ever eat with a Christian?
Was I ever taught by any but a Jew? No, you have taught me to despise
the Christians!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rabbi.</span></p>

<p>They persecuted us for ages; they have not taught us to admire them.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>They have ceased to persecute us, they have taken down the stones of the
Ghetto walls, but still we are taught to despise them; still we try to
think ourselves the chosen people. We set ourselves as a race against
them and the universal brotherhood of man. This is the proof of it: <i>our
women we marry, theirs we pay!</i></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rabbi.</span></p>

<p>That is not true; it's a shameful calumny!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>I can pick you ten young men to prove it&mdash;out of those that heard you
preach to-day!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rabbi.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>How dare you say such a thing! Are you a Jew no longer? Am I speaking to
a Christian?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>You are speaking to a Jew who claims to-day and to-morrow as his
own&mdash;not yesterday! A Jew who believes that it shall not be asked if a
man worship in a synagogue or in a cathedral, in a chapel or in a
mosque, or in silence and solitude under God's own dome! And the
falsehood you have brought me up by; our hatred and our bigotry which
keeps us away from them, our cursed earthiness which keeps them away
from us&mdash;I loathe it all&mdash;I hate it&mdash;I will fight it as long as I live!
I am a Jew&mdash;a Jew of to-day and to-morrow; and every man whom God
created in his image is my brother!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rabbi.</span></p>

<p>The boy's gone daft! Daft!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span></p>

<p>No, not that; he's been poisoned&mdash;poisoned by this damned creature in my
house! She's his&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rabbi.</span></p>

<p>Be still! I lost my self-control&mdash;set me a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> example. I&mdash;I&mdash;it is
many years&mdash;indeed, I may say I have never listened to such a tirade!
Let me tell you, you will live to regret what you have said here in the
very shadow of the synagogue. I will not treat it seriously; I cannot!
That you&mdash;a mere boy who has gobbled a bit here and a bit there from the
Book of Law, should have the monstrous effrontery to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rafael.</span></p>

<p>Father, are you ready to walk home now?</p>

different view of his people. Do you fear he won't come back; not come
back to his home&mdash;to his blind old father? You are foolish, Sachel!
Drive him away, and he'll find that there is no home in the world like a
Jewish home&mdash;that a clock ticks nowhere in the world as it does by one's
own hearth. Ah, the Christians don't know what family life is; they have
nothing to compare with ours. It is because we stay by one another,
because we are sober and temperate and industrious and respectful of our
elders!</p>

<p>Marry? Who spoke of marrying? He doesn't want to marry yet; I wouldn't

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sachel</span>, <i>pale, bowed and trembling; the two sit on a bench at the

<p>Then it is true that you have not heard from Rafael for a week? What
happened that day, after the officers had dispersed the crowd?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a sob, then restraining his emotions.</i>] He brought her back here
to get the few things that belong to her. He said that as soon as he had
done with Hanakoff he would come and get her. Then he went away. He said
he would be back in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> morning; and he has been gone a week! My God,
it was I who made him so anxious to leave&mdash;it is the judgment of the
Almighty upon my sins!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Calculatingly, as he looks at the letters in his hand.</i>] Oh, he's your
son; I fancy if he got in the vicinity of harm, he saw it before it saw
him! And the girl, why do you let her stay here?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span></p>

<p>The Rabbi! The Rabbi came here and made me promise to keep the girl
until Rafael could find a home for her. I thought it would be the next
day; I promised. The Rabbi said he repented the strong words he had
uttered when he slammed the door of the synagogue. H'm! The Rabbi is not
much better than you, or at least, than me! The only difference is that
the Rabbi is always repenting! If Rafael would only come back, I'd let
him keep the girl here for ever&mdash;what do I care! I want my son&mdash;the only
thing I live for!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span></p>

<p>But doesn't the girl know where he is?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span></p>

<p>No, no. Esther kept telling me that Rosa has had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> no word from Rafael. I
would not believe it; and this morning I took hold of her; I cursed her
up and down for not telling me where he was. She said if she knew where
he was she would walk to him, if it was a thousand miles, rather than
stay another night under my roof. Then, for the third time this week,
she had a fit of hysterics&mdash;I never heard such sobs in all my life! When
she quieted down she went up and put on the rags she first came here in;
and since then she has refused to take food from us; she won't enter the
house; she is wandering about here somewhere now. I don't know; though
she be a Christian and a pauper, I suppose I'll have to accept her for
my daughter-in-law, if he'll only come!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span></p>

<p>She, that broke up your home and took your son away from the finest
young woman in the Ghetto? She, that robbed him of his faith and brought
him to a pass where every one is saying that he has run away rather than
face the consequences of his acts? H'm!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span></p>

<p>What am I going to do? If he's dead, I <i>will</i> keep her! Isn't she the
only one in the world whose sorrow will approach mine?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rabbi.</span></p>

<p>Good evening! How is that girl? Is she still crying her eyes out? It's

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rabbi.</span></p>

<p>Oh, she's gone to bed&mdash;good! Sachel, Rafael had my promise to protect
that girl; and I will protect her. Last Saturday we were all
overwrought; we were taken by surprise. But now that we all realise it,
it comes to this: Rafael has married a Christian girl; she knows what an
affront this is to the religion in which Rafael was reared, and to which
inevitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> he must return his full devotion when he grows an older and
wiser man. Now there is but one remedy: Rosa must become a Jewess. Not
to-night or to-morrow; but she must be influenced to open her heart to
the faith of her husband; and she must be urged to welcome a future day
when she shall enter the synagogue and come forth from there with all
the hatred, all the revulsion which she has seen in our faces to-day,
buried for ever! Teach her to be thankful that this is Holland, where a
Christian <i>may</i> become a Jewess.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span></p>

<p>Rabbi, your sentiments are worthy of your calling. Sachel and I have
been talking; we both regret our bitter words of that day. Sachel has
become reconciled&mdash;as much as any Jew could. And, to tell the truth, we
had gone so far as to dismiss the subject and to devote ourselves to a
very important matter of business which had to go over from Friday.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rabbi.</span></p>

<p>I see&mdash;I see! I am very glad, then! We must make Rosa understand the
things that are glorious in our religion; the inspirations that have
sustained us through centuries of the bitterest persecution that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span> men
have ever known. And she must believe that we shall cling to them until
that supreme day when Jerusalem is peopled anew with the race which God
has chosen for His own. Is it not so?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span></p>

<p>Yes, yes! And we'll walk a little way with you. Then, Aaron, you can
come back, and we can go on with that business.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>They go up</i>: <span class="smcap">The Rabbi</span> <i>stops at the bridge</i>.<br />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Rabbi.</span></p>

<p>Very well; but you will treat the young girl tenderly, my friends? Look
here; you and Esther and Rafael bring her to my house some night when
there will be no one else there. We'll let her feel the warmth of our
hearts, as if she were already a Jewess. We will show her what the inner
life of the Jews is; the life that the Christians have no conception of.

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span></p>

<p>Of course, of course! [<i>Pulls the letters from his pocket.</i>] But the
main probability is that Rafael will soon return. I am only thinking
whether before he returns this girl could not be influenced to leave
here, made to believe that the boy has deserted her? You can't blame me
for considering my daughter's feelings in this matter. Now suppose we
could let drop a few things in Rosa's presence, without appearing to
know that she overheard?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span></p>

<p>I don't care about her! I want <i>him</i> to come back.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Don't you see: after a whole week, after all her waiting and waiting,
without a word from him and with her whole life trembling in the
balance, then if she overhears certain things&mdash;&mdash;! Of course if we try
to persuade her he is gone, she'll suspect at once. But there are
certain remarks that we can let drop, quite casually, you know, that
will absolutely make her believe that he does not intend to come back;
that he has deserted her.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span></p>

<p>But she <i>won't</i> believe it!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span></p>

<p>No, not if we try to convince her! But we won't try! You only make
certain statements within her hearing; and if she says they are not
true, just shrug your shoulders! What is in that girl's mind? Either
that he has met harm, or that he is afraid to come back to her; that the
poverty staring him in the face has been too much for him. Seven days is
a long time when a woman is alone on the rack of doubt. Now, do you see
what I mean?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>But I want my son! I don't care whether he marries your daughter! I want

<p>[<i>Tapping the letters.</i>] Here are some letters. One for you and four for

<p>He's all right! He's all right! [<i>Pauses, suddenly.</i>] Look here, you

<p>[<i>Reads.</i>] "My darling: If I take ship at once with Hanakoff for London,
I have the opportunity of a life time; it will fix me in my career as I
had never dreamed of. My mind tells my heart that I must go; but I am as
joyful as I am sorrowful; for in a week, dear, I take you away from the
stifling air you breathe to-night&mdash;out of the Ghetto, into the freedom
which is the right of our love. Good night, my angel! Your Rafael."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span></p>

<p>He'll have money now. He'll never look at me again. She's got him! She's
got him! O, I would to my Maker I were dead!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>No, no! She hasn't got him! She shan't have him! Don't you see, this
clears the way for the very thing I proposed to you.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span></p>

<p>What? What? It might succeed, with the girl in the state she is. But if
it does, what will Rafael say, to-morrow?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span></p>

<p>Eh? Why, if he finds her gone and she left no word, let him draw his own
conclusions; that she was afraid to stand by him; afraid to share his
poverty. You say "to-morrow"? He may be back to-night! It's your one
chance. If it succeeds, the girl goes, with two hundred guilders in her
pocket; Rafael stays home&mdash;in due time marries Rebecca&mdash;becomes a
successful Jew. If it fails&mdash;then this Christian robs you of him anyway!
[<span class="smcap">Sachel</span> <i>ponders; then suddenly touches him; they listen;</i> <span class="smcap">Aaron</span>
<i>whispers</i>.] Only casually; not an effort to convince her! She can't help
believing it, then!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span></p>

<p>Sh&mdash;!</p>

<p class="scene"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Rosa</span>, <i>by the bridge; she drops her hands, hopelessly, and stays
near the bridge, turned away from them</i>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Without looking about, whispers.</i>] Was that her step? [<span class="smcap">Sachel</span> <i>nods; a
pause;</i> <span class="smcap">Aaron</span> <i>begins in a moderate tone</i>.] Yes; but a man who gives his
word to one girl and then deserts her, would desert another girl. Shall
I let my daughter risk that? No!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span></p>

<p>But I tell you it is not a parallel case! A marriage solemnised in a
synagogue is one thing; but a marriage such as this&mdash;which we all know
is not a marriage, either inside or outside the Ghetto&mdash;I tell you it's
totally different!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span></p>

<p>Didn't he commit himself morally? Very well! Then he goes and finds that
he has been tricked by a venial under-magistrate, for the sake of thirty
guilders; and he finds that it was no marriage at all! The girl is
reduced merely to the position of his mistress&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, doesn't that dispose of <i>her</i>? Doesn't that rid him of
responsibility?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span></p>

<p>Yes; but it is a high moral consideration that occupies me. The boy
found that he could rid himself of his burden; the discovery came when
he had been looking about for a week, and finding nothing but poverty,
privation and despair on every side; no one would lend him money; none
of his former friends would speak to him; there was only the choice
between an absolutely hopeless struggle and running away. He ran! And I
say a young man who has thus been tried and found wanting is no man to
be my daughter's husband!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sachel.</span></p>

<p>O! Because Rafael has had one mistress is he not good enough to be your
daughter's husband?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean! What do you mean, Sachel! [<i>The two men rise,
affecting surprise.</i>] It is a lie! It is a cruel lie!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span></p>

<p>Eh? Doesn't the <i>girl</i> know about it?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>What do you mean by saying that he ran away from me? How do you know
that he ran away from me? Where is he! Tell me where he is! Quick, you
shall!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span></p>

<p>No one will know where he is until he has spent the money he sent for.
And that ought to keep him a year, even in England.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>England&mdash;you say he has gone to England? You tell me he has deserted me?
After what he said before the synagogue? I say it's a lie&mdash;a
preposterous lie! It isn't true that I am only his mistress&mdash;it's a lie!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span></p>

<p>I'll tell you what <i>is</i> true; after this escapade with you he'll have to
prove himself a man before he marries my daughter.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>He can't marry your daughter! He's mine! O, God, what does this mean?
Can't you find him? Can't you let me see him? He would have written to
me&mdash;I know he would! Sachel, let me go to him. Sachel, tell me where he
is!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>What could Sachel do, even if he could reach the boy? After seven days,
at the very moment Sachel has been persuaded to accept all this&mdash;to
treat you as his daughter&mdash;here slinks Rafael along the canal and up
through the warehouse and whispers that he has given you up! Then he
wheedles his father out of more money than I would give ten sons, and
then boards a ship for England! [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Sachel</span>.] Do you think I'll see my
daughter marry such a man? If he wants to return next year on the hope
of marrying Rebecca, you tell him to remain in England!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Rosa.</span></p>

<p>It's a lie! He couldn't desert me. He's a man of soul&mdash;of honour! It
isn't true. My God, it can't be true!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Aaron.</span></p>

<p>You'd better find a place to sleep, and then compose yourself to make
the best of it. I have a friend in the country who will receive you.

life over again. Come!</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
